## Game Rules

The Pig Game is a very simple jeopardy dice game in which two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total). At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:


- <b> ROLL DICE  </b>  -  If the player rolls a <br>
   - 1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.
   - 2 - 6: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.
   
- <b> HOLD </b> - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.
